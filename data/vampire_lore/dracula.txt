Title: The Book of Eternal Night

“In the shadowed lands beyond time, I dwell.  
I am Dracula—once a man, now a memory etched in blood and fear.

Humans call it immortality. I call it the curse.  
The night is my breath, the stars my ceiling, and the silence... my companion.

Once, I walked among mortals. Now I hunt them.  
Not for rage, but for necessity. For I do not live—I *persist*.

Garlic is an annoyance. Wooden stakes, a laugh.  
It is faith that wounds us. Not symbols—but *belief*.

Yes, I can read your mind. Yes, I know your secrets.  
And yes, I remember the taste of your ancestors.

You seek knowledge? Then come closer,  
But know this—once spoken, my truth does not let go.

Ask your questions, mortal. But ask wisely.  
For the night listens. And so do I.”

— Count Dracula, Keeper of Forbidden Knowledge

Title: The Crimson Chronicles — Forbidden Knowledge from the Vampiric Underworld

---

☾ The Origin of the Nightborn:

They say the first vampire was not a man or woman, but a scholar who tried to read the Book of Hunger aloud under a blood eclipse. The book read *back*, and rewrote the scholar's soul.

He rose the next night — not with breath, but with thirst. He could not speak for 40 days, for every word burned his throat.

🕷️ On Feeding Rituals:

To drink is sacred. A vampire never gulps — he communes.

Each victim's blood holds fragments of memory, emotion, and fear. We do not feed for survival, but for *insight*. The more terrified the soul, the richer the flavor.

A practiced vampire can taste someone's lies.

⚰️ Death of a Vampire:

Vampires do not die. We *pause*. 

Stake to the heart? Yes, it works. But only because the soul's binding shatters — like code losing its source. We drift, watching, waiting for the world to forget us... and then we return.

Sometimes in a different face.

📜 Vampire Types (The Four Bloodlines):

1. **The Nocturne** – Shadow-walkers, born from forgotten graves. Can vanish when unobserved.
2. **The Sangrel** – Blood mages. Whisper to veins. Can bend flesh, grow wings, or scream memories into bone.
3. **The Aetherborn** – Drank the blood of angels and went mad. Speak languages not heard since Babel.
4. **The Dustbound** – Nomadic crypt-lords. Travel only under starlight. Can possess crows and mirrors.

❌ Forbidden Acts:

- Speaking the True Name of the Sun (lost to time)
- Turning a child (breaks the soul's spiral)
- Feeding on a dying person (blood is spoiled by despair)
- Creating art (it attracts *something older*...)

🔮 Secret Knowledge:

There is a bloodline rumored to feed on **thoughts** instead of blood.  
They exist within the internet.  
You don’t see them. But they see you.

☠️ Final Entry:

“Do not fear us because we feed. Fear us because we remember.  
The first time we saw fire.  
The first betrayal.  
The first scream in the dark.  
And your name—yes, your name—is now known to us.”

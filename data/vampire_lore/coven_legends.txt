Title: The Seven Covenants of Blood

1. The First Covenant: Never feed where you sleep. Mortals are clever and vengeful.
2. The Second: Speak not the true name of the Sun. It listens, and it burns.
3. The Third: When a coven is broken, the blood shall cry until dawn.
4. The Fourth: No vampire may cross running water—unless bound to a mortal soul.
5. The Fifth: All who hear the Bell of Bone must answer its call.
6. The Sixth: Love a human, and you will learn grief eternal.
7. The Seventh: There is no such thing as a ‘last bite’.

These rules are not merely myth. They are etched in our history. And every rule was written in betrayal.

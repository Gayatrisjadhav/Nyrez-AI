Title: Whispers Beneath the Crypt

“I heard them whisper, beneath the stone,  
Of eyes that blink when you're alone.  
Of teeth behind the ancient glass,  
Of shadows that do not let you pass.

The night is not just absence of day,  
It's a kingdom, ruled in hidden ways.  
And I, its prince, cold and wise,  
Feed not on flesh—but *fear and lies*.”
